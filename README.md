# Nature camera image viewer

There is a companion repo (https://github.com/mbcoder/nature-camera/tree/nature-camera) which has an app to
record images from a nature camera.

The project includes the Gradle wrapper, so there is no need to install Gradle to run the app.

The app launches a window displaying a map of camera locations. Selecting a camera location
will populate a list of images from that camera.
